## Boot Camp Overview
The growing trend in biological and biomedical research is the use of assays that measure various "omics" data types, such as transcriptome, proteome, genomic variants, epigenetic marks, metabolome, and functional assays, at single-cell and/or spatial resolution. Additionally, there is an urgent need for joint statistical and computational modeling, as well as mechanistic and integrated statistical analysis of these data, to discover important underlying patterns, categories, or trends, and to arrive at statistically robust conclusions using explainable models of reasoning. The boot camp aims to provide participants with an overview of the conceptual and statistical foundations that underlie existing and emerging integrative multimodal data strategies as well as practical trade-offs between various methods. Participants will gain hands-on experience with software implementation, quality assessment of inputs and outputs, method performance assessments, tuning, and model fit interpretation, as well as relevant open science practices through practical sessions using real-world examples.


## Key Features

- **Expert Instructors:** Benefit from the expertise of seasoned instructors who specialize in multi-omics analysis. Acquire practical skills and theoretical knowledge that can be applied to real-world research scenarios.

- **Logistics:** Organizers are responsible for covering the travel and meal costs of the instructors, ensuring a seamless and enriching learning experience for everyone involved.

## Audience 
The workshop is designed for undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers from universities. Please engage actively in discussions and hands-on activities to make the most of this opportunity.

## Requirements
- **University Registration:** Interested universities and community organizations are required to register first.

- **Date and Time Coordination:** Once registered, we will work collaboratively to fix the date and time of the boot camp, accommodating the preferences of the participating institutions.

## Technical Requirements
- **Personal Laptops with Charger:** Participants are required to bring their personal laptops along with the respective chargers. Ensure that your laptop is in good working condition for hands-on sessions during the workshop.

- **Good Internet Connection (University):** Access to a stable and reliable internet connection, preferably from your university network, is crucial for smooth participation in online components of the workshop.Verify and test your internet connection in advance to avoid disruptions during the sessions.

- **Software Installation:** Be prepared to install specific software or tools on your laptop as per the workshop requirements. Details regarding the required software will be shared in advance.


## Cautions
- **Data Backup:** Prior to the workshop, back up any important data on your laptop to prevent potential loss during software installations or other activities.

- **Power Backup:** If available, consider bringing a portable power bank to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the workshop.

- **Privacy Settings:** Be mindful of your privacy settings, especially during interactive sessions. 

- **Avoid Multitasking:** To make the most of the workshop, minimize multitasking during sessions and allocate dedicated time for learning.
