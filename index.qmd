## Boot Camp Overview
The growing trend in biological and biomedical research is the use of assays that measure various "omics" data types, such as transcriptome, proteome, genomic variants, epigenetic marks, metabolome, and functional assays, at single-cell and/or spatial resolution. Additionally, there is an urgent need for joint statistical and computational modeling, as well as mechanistic and integrated statistical analysis of these data, to discover important underlying patterns, categories, or trends, and to arrive at statistically robust conclusions using explainable models of reasoning. The boot camp aims to provide participants with an overview of the conceptual and statistical foundations that underlie existing and emerging integrative multimodal data strategies as well as practical trade-offs between various methods. Participants will gain hands-on experience with software implementation, quality assessment of inputs and outputs, method performance assessments, tuning, and model fit interpretation, as well as relevant open science practices through practical sessions using real-world examples.

## Transcriptomics
:::{.grid}
::: {.g-col-10}
Transcriptomics is the study of transcriptomes, which investigates RNA transcripts within a cell or tissue to determine what genes are being expressed and in what proportion. These RNA transcripts include mRNAs, tRNA, rRNA and other non-coding RNA presents in a cell.
